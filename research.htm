<h3> Real-time single-cell biology</h3>
<p> Advances in imaging technologies have opened a new window on the
dynamic biochemical events occurring in individual living cells.  Automated microscopy allows populations of 
hundreds of cells to be observed simultaneously, while advances in fluorescent biosensors allow many signaling pathways 
to be tracked in real time.  This technology has revealed two surprising facets of cell signaling.  First, signaling events 
are unexpectedly dynamic, even under steady-state conditions.  Second, even genetically identical cells can vary
widely in their response to stimuli or drugs.  Together, these findings indicate that
there are still substantial gaps in our understanding of how many signaling pathways work and how they are interpreted by the cell.  
<br>
<h3>Information flow in single cells</h3>
<p>Our lab uses single-cell technologies to develop a more accurate mechanistic 
model of key signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation and survival.
Pathways including ERK, Akt, mTOR, AMPK, and Hippo are activated by factors in 
the cellular microenvironment (including growth factors, 
nutrients, extracellular matrix contacts, and cell-cell interactions). Through the phosphorylation of
numerous targets, this core signaling network controls central aspects of
cellular behavior such as metabolic flux, growth, and DNA replication,
which in turn determine cell phenotypes such as proliferation,
apoptosis, and autophagy. A long-standing challenge in cell biology has
been to understand how this limited set of kinase/transcription
pathways can achieve specific control of cell fate in response to the
diverse set of inputs integrated by the network. A potential answer to
this question is suggested by the highly dynamic and individualized
single-cell dynamics of ERK and other components of the core
network, including mTOR, Akt, and AMPK. Such dynamic patterns
are capable of carrying a large quantity of information and, as we have
demonstrated, are capable of determining cell fate. We are exploring the
 hypothesis that 1) the unique pattern of signaling dynamics
within each cell encodes the integrated status of multiple aspects of
the microenvironment and that 2) differential cell fates are be
specified by decoding certain patterns of core pathway activity.

<h4>Dynamic heterogeneity and drug responses</h4>
<p>Targeted signaling inhibitors represent the forefront of
modern cancer therapy, but most show limited long-term efficacy
following initially promising responses, because of the ability of
cancer cells to adapt to the loss of a single signaling pathway. Recent
studies have found greatly increased efficacy when such inhibitors are
administered intermittently or in a specific sequence with other drugs.
However, the space of possible treatment regimens is large
and cannot be explored practically using experiments alone. We are
using our live-cell reporters to profile both acute and long-term
signaling and metabolic behavior in response to targeted inhibitor
treatments, with the goal of developing potential treatment regimes that direct the
cellular signaling and metabolic
state toward a target cell fate (e.g. cell death). This analysis takes into
account the heterogeneity of states within the population and considers
not only whether the majority of cells are induced to take on
the target fate, but also whether undesirable secondary states (such as
rapid proliferation or differentiation into drug-resistant states) are
effectively avoided. </p>
</p>
<h3>Expanding the single-cell repertoire</h3>
<p> The ability of live-cell microscopy to reveal signaling
dynamics is still limited to a handful of pathways
for which effective reporters have been developed. We are working to develop new and generalizeable strategies for reporter
construction. </p>
